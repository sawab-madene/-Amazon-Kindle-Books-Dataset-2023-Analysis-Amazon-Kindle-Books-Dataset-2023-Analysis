About the project
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information on 130,000 Kindle e-books, collected through web scraping in October 2023. The goal of the analysis is to explore trends in popular categories, authors, and sellers, as well as understand the impact of different tags (e.g., best-seller, editorâ€™s pick, Goodreads Choice Award) on the popularity of e-books. Additionally, the analysis will explore potential seasonality in e-book popularity.
